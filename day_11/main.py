## The deck is unlimited in size. 
## There are no jokers. 
## The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
## The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
## Use the following list as the deck of cards:
## cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
## The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
## Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
## The computer is the dealer.

# Flow
# Do you want to play a game of Blackjack? Type 'y' or 'n':  ||| Not going to ask... you opened it, you play it.
# Prints the logo each time
# Shows your cards, in a list format
# Shows dealer first card
# 'h' for hit, 's' for stand
# hit add a new card to your hand
# -> adds new card to your hand, show dealer hand again, if > 21, game ends and dealer wins else ask for next move
# stand ends your hand and shows dealer
# -> Dealer hits if < 16 else stand
# -> if dealer > 21 player wins elif 21 <= dealer <= player dealer wins elif dealer == player draw else player wins
# Ace can be 1 or 11. if ace in hand and hand > 21, convert ace to 1.
# If player hand 10 + 11, auto win.
